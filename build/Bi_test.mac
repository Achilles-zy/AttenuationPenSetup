#Example of macro to be used for PEN analysis studies
#Choise of setup:0 5 PMT setup with 1 PEN sample and acrylic; 1 attenuation setup; 2 includes 5 PEN stacked samples in 5 PMT setup; 3 spectrometer setup
/PEN/det/setDetectorType 3
#Set the position of the collimator, a values between -37 and 37 mm (size of samples), not used in case of detector type 3
#/PEN/det/setCollimatorPositionX -10. mm
#Set the light yield, in case you need to change, not important for detector type 3
#/PEN/det/setLY 3000
#set the absorption, this values is used to multiply the curve of absorption as function of wl: i.e: f(wl) = a[x]*this_value
/PEN/det/setABS 5.
#set roughness of samples, 1. perfect polished surface 0. not polishment, for PEN should be close to 1 
/PEN/det/setSigAlpha 0.9

#set the position of the source, with same limits as for collimator between -37 and 37 mm (size of samples)
/PEN/gun/sourcePositionX -10. mm
#Choise of source type: 0 Cs-137; 1 Bi-207; 2 Sr-90; 3 e-
