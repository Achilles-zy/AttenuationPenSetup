#Example of macro to be used for PEN analysis studies
#Choise of setup:0 5 PMT setup with 1 PEN sample and acrylic; 1 attenuation setup; 2 (being implemented) 5 PEN stacked samples in 5 PMT setup
/PEN/det/setDetectorType 2
#Set the position of the collimator, a values between -37 and 37 mm (size of samples)
/PEN/det/setCollimatorPositionX 0. mm
#Set the light yield
#/PEN/det/setLY 5000
/PEN/det/setTargetMat PVT_structure
#set the absorption, this values is added to the curve of absorption as function of wl: i.e: f(wl) = a[x] + new value
#/PEN/det/setABS 1.5
#set roughness of samples, 1. perfect polished surface 0. not polishment 
/PEN/det/setSigAlpha 0.7

#set the position of the source, MUST be the same of the collimator if you want it to work
